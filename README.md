# luecktree
My final commit to Luecktree Version 2.0. The code was pretty sloppy and thrown together pretty quick ngl. It looks pretty good and in Version 2.5 or 3.0 I might add constant button aniimations. This is only compatible on mobile devices because it is only meant to be put in an Instagram bio, a mainly mobile app. Once I get the code arranged better I might put the outline of the code on github so people who know HTML can create a linktree like this with ease. :)
